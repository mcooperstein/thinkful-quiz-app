# thinkful-quiz-app
This is a quiz app that I made as part of Thinkful's Frontend Web Development Course

## Introduction
This is one of the earlier projects I made in the Thinkful coding bootcamp course. The focus of this project was to use jQuery to create a quiz app based on a subject of your choosing. I chose to make my quiz about movies, since I'm a big movie buff and a fan of movie-related trivia.

## Programming Skills Used
This project uses jQuery to create an interactive application that responds to the user's actions (ie click events) to lead users through the quiz. After each question, the user is notified what the correct answer for that question was. At the end of the quiz, the user receives their score, and various messages will display depending on what score the user got. Later in the course, I went back to this project and added Gulp build tools to the project to automate my build tasks and compile my code into smaller files to help speed up page load. It was also a good way to practice and solidfy my understanding of Gulp.js.
